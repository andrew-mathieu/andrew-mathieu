# ANDREW_MATHIEU (AMTH)

Humanist designer born in 2000 in Charleroi, Belgium, where my curiosity for art and storytelling was nurtured. After studying applied arts and completing a commerce apprenticeship, I co-founded Appshine with Verdi, collaborating with international professionals. My journey led me to roles as a UI/UX designer at AskMora and webmaster for Stop Harc√®lement Ferroviaire, deepening my passion for human-centered digital solutions. Today, with expertise in React, Vue, Nuxt, and GSAP, I thrive on crafting intuitive digital experiences driven by empathy and a desire to create meaningful impact.

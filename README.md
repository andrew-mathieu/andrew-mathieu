# Hi, I'm Andrew Mathieu üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm a 23 years old front-end developer based in Belgium. I love experimenting with new things in code, and learning new things every time. I also like the back-end but it's not my main activity, so I don't consider myself too "fullstack developer", even if I have skills in it... I'm also into artifical intelligence.

I have a background as a music producer, I still do it sometimes but I don't enjoy it as much as before. My passion for coding came to me after I became interested in UI design.

## üì¶ - Projects

I'm not very active on GitHub and rarely post repos because most of the projects I'm on are confidential. But I plan to release more projects in the coming months.

In the meantime, you can check out [Prospectools](https://github.com/andrew-mathieu/prospectools) which is a little project I made in only a few hours which allows me to prospect more easily.

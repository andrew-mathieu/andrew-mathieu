# Hi, I'm Andrew Mathieu üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm a 23 years old front-end developer based in Belgium. I love experimenting with new things in code, and learning new things every time. I also like the back-end but it's not my main activity, so I don't consider myself too "fullstack developer", even if I have skills in it... I'm also into artifical intelligence.

I have a background as a music producer, I still do it sometimes but I don't enjoy it as much as before. My passion for coding came to me after I became interested in UI design.
